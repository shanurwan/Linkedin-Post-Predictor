# LinkedIn Engagement Predictor: Turning Real Posts into Real-Time Insights

## Current Progress : Collecting Data

## Project Draft

## ✅ Milestone 1: 30 Posts Collected
🎯 Goal: Early data exploration & prototype

- Clean and structure your dataset (CSV or DataFrame)

- Calculate basic metrics (engagement rate, word count, time features)

- Visualize simple patterns:

- Best/worst post times

- Hashtag use vs. engagement

- Run a basic regression/classifier (even if accuracy is low)

- Draft UI layout idea for Streamlit app

- Log observations: What features seem to matter?

## 🧪 Milestone 2: 50 Posts Collected
🎯 Goal: MVP Model + Draft App

 - Re-train model with new data

 Try:

Linear Regression / Random Forest Regressor

Or: Binary Classifier (High vs Low Engagement)

- Build first version of Streamlit app:

User inputs post text / time

App predicts engagement level

- Test app privately and log predictions vs. actuals

## 📊 Milestone 3: 100 Posts Collected
🎯 Goal: Insights + Model Improvement

- Feature engineer:

Day of week (One-hot)

Post length buckets (Short/Medium/Long)

Text sentiment (optional)

- Evaluate feature importance

 Improve model selection (try XGBoost, LightGBM)

- Add visualizations to Streamlit:

Top 5 performing post types

Engagement trend over time

- Begin writing short tips based on data (can use in app or post)

## ⚙️ Milestone 4: 200 Posts Collected
🎯 Goal: More robust predictions + broader testing

- Fine-tune hyperparameters

- Add confidence interval / probability output

- Allow users to simulate new post scenario in app

- Log engagement drift — how has it changed over 200 posts?

- Update app styling + add export/download results option

## 🚀 Milestone 5: 300 Posts Collected
🎯 Goal: Go public + portfolio-ready

- Final polish for Streamlit app

- Host app on Streamlit Cloud (or Render)

- Write README + GitHub repo (clean + clear)

- Share app + insights on LinkedIn

- Optional: Run A/B test posts using model’s suggestion vs. random

## 🧠 Milestone 6: 500 Posts Collected
🎯 Goal: Advanced model + storytelling

- Train deep learning model (e.g. LSTM or text embedding model using post content)

- Add NLP-based input features (keywords, tone, readability)

- Add user clustering: Are there different audience groups engaging differently?

- Turn app into an intelligent content planner (when + what to post)

- Package everything as a “Content Strategy Assistant” for creators/recruiters
